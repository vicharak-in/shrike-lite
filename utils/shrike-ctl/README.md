# Shrike-ctl

A utility to program the FPGA on the Shrike development board directly from your PC.

## Overview

The flashing utility uses these key files:

1. `shrike-ctl.py` – Python host-side tool running on the PC to send the FPGA bitstream over a serial port.  
2. `shrike-ctl.uf2` – Prebuilt firmware image for the RP2040 MCU on board Shrike ; when flashed, it turns the board into an FPGA programmer.

## Prerequisite: Flashing the UF2 Firmware

### Drag-and-drop UF2

- Put Shrike in BOOTSEL mode (hold BOOTSEL while plugging in USB).  
- A USB mass-storage device appears on the PC.  
- Drag and drop `shrike-ctl.uf2` which can be found [here](./shrike-ctl.uf2) onto this drive. 
- The board reboots and now runs the FPGA flasher firmware. 
- This method uses the provided `.uf2` built from `shrike-ctl.c` and `CMakeLists.txt`. 


## Programming the FPGA from PC

Once the board is running the shrike-ctl firmware, the FPGA can be  programmed from the PC using `shrike-ctl.py`.

### Requirements

1. Python version 3.12 or above installed on the host PC.  
2. `shrike-ctl.py` script.  
3. FPGA bitstream file generated by your FPGA tools.

### Usage

Exicute the Python script with argumnets for the serial port and bitstream path, 

for example:

```
python shrike-ctl.py <PORT> <BitstreamFilePath>`
```

Where:

- `<PORT>` is the serial port name (e.g., `COM5` on Windows, `/dev/ttyACM0` or `/dev/ttyUSB0` on Linux).  
- `<BitstreamFilePath>` is the path to your FPGA bitstream file.
